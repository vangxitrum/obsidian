# Changelog

## v0.3.0 (unreleased)

Twelve utility packages imported from `depin`, three new packages, and one
security rule added to `config`. Everything is additive except the move of
`stats/version`, which leaves aliases behind.

### Added

**Twelve packages imported from depin**, with their commit history, keeping
their original package names so a later migration off depin's copies is an
import path rewrite rather than an API rewrite:

`base58`, `context2`, `date`, `errs2`, `leak`, `lrucache`, `memory`, `period`,
`readcloser`, `signal`, `slices2`, `time2`.

**`secret`** - bearer secrets that are never at rest in a replayable form.
`Token` is plaintext and redacts itself through fmt, slog, JSON and SQL;
`Hash` is what you store. Prefixed API keys carry a public lookup id, so
verification is one indexed row rather than a scan over every stored hash.
Recovery codes use Crockford base32, which folds the characters people
mistype. See [`secret/README.md`](secret/README.md).

**`jwt`** - signed tokens for a verifier that cannot reach the issuer's
database, with a shared secret or a key pair. The algorithm is pinned at
construction and the header's `alg` is never trusted, closing algorithm
confusion and `alg: none`. An expiry is required on both sides. `Ring`
rotates keys on `kid` without invalidating tokens in flight. See
[`jwt/README.md`](jwt/README.md).

**`version.SemVer`** - a comparable semantic version, tolerant on input
because internal builds disagree about the leading `v`. An untagged build now
derives `v0.0.0-dev.<unix>.g<commit>`, which sorts below every real tag.

**`version.Register`** - the build stamp as a monkit `StatSource`, so
`/metrics` carries a `version_info` series.

**`config` secret handling** - `secret:"true"` / `secret:"optional"` on a
field, and `config.CheckSecrets` at startup. See below.

**`stats/testcontext`** gained `Go`, `Wait` and `Cleanup` for tracking
background goroutines in a test.

### Changed

**`stats/version` moved to `version`.** It stopped being a stats concern once
it grew version comparison and a metrics source. `stats/version` remains as
type aliases with deprecation notices, so no import breaks.

**`Info.Version` is now a `SemVer`, not a `string`.** Rendering is unchanged -
it still marshals as a `v`-prefixed string - but it can now be compared. Code
that treated the field as a string needs `.String()`.

**A `secret`-tagged config field may no longer carry a `default` or
`releaseDefault`.** `Bind` panics if it does. This is a deliberate breaking
change for any struct that shipped a placeholder secret, which is the point:
a default reaches production, so a placeholder password in the source tree is
the password of every deployment that never overrode it.

To keep a local convenience value, pair `devDefault` with an explicitly empty
`releaseDefault`:

```go
Password string `secret:"true" devDefault:"dev-only" releaseDefault:""`
```

### Fixed

`stats/README.md` documented `-ldflags -X` targeting struct fields
(`...version.Build.Release=`). The linker only patches plain `string`
variables, so those flags were silently doing nothing. The corrected
invocation targets package-level variables in the new `version` package, and
uses `git describe --abbrev=0`, since bare `git describe` output sorts below
its own tag under semver rules.

### Dependencies

Three modules added, each with no dependencies of its own:
`blang/semver/v4`, `golang-jwt/jwt/v5`, and `zeebo/errs/v2` promoted to
direct use. `zeebo/errs` v1, which arrived with the imported packages, was
converted away rather than added.

### Migration

See [`docs/ADOPTING.md`](docs/ADOPTING.md).

| Old | New |
| --- | --- |
| `aioz-common/stats/version` | `aioz-common/version` |
| `info.Version` (string) | `info.Version.String()` |
| `-X .../stats/version.Build.X=` | `-X .../version.buildVersion=` |

## v0.2.0

`uuid` and `currency`; the build stamp derived from Go build info; `apierr`
trimmed to its core.

## v0.1.0

The initial module, assembled from `aioz-config`, `aioz-logger`, `aioz-stats`
and `aioz-template`'s `internal/utils`.

# Adopting aioz-common in a service

Each package documents itself. This is the part no single package README can
say: what a service wires up on day one, in what order, and which of the
choices are actually load-bearing.

```bash
go get gitlab.internal/tuan.quang.tran/aioz-common
```

## The shape of a service

```go
// At init, so the flags exist before cobra parses them.
config.Bind(cmd, &cfg, config.ConfDir(dir))

func run(ctx context.Context, cmd *cobra.Command) error {
    // 1. Configuration, before anything that needs it.
    if _, err := config.Load(cmd); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    if err := config.CheckSecrets(&cfg); err != nil {
        return err   // refuse to start rather than run on an empty key
    }

    // 2. Logging, so everything after this is observable.
    handler, _, err := logging.New(cfg.Logging)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    log := slog.New(handler)

    // 3. Metrics, including the build stamp.
    monitor.Register(nil)
    version.Register(nil)

    // 4. Components, started together and closed in reverse.
    group := lifecycle.NewGroup(log)
    group.Add(lifecycle.Item{
        Name:  "debug",
        Run:   debugServer.Run,
        Close: debugServer.Close,
    })

    runners, ctx := errgroup.WithContext(ctx)
    group.Run(ctx, runners)
    return runners.Wait()
}
```

`Group.Run` takes an `errgroup.Group` and starts each item in it, so the
caller owns the wait and the first real failure cancels the rest. `Item.Run`
and `Item.Close` are both optional: a component that only needs stopping, such
as a cache or a connection pool, supplies `Close` alone.

Steps 1 and 2 are ordered for a reason: a configuration error has to be
reportable, and `logging.Bootstrap` exists precisely so there is a logger
before the configured one is built.

## Configuration

Defaults, help text and persistence rules live on the struct. See
[`config`](../config/README.md) for the full tag reference.

The one rule worth repeating here, because getting it wrong is a security bug
rather than a bug:

```go
type Config struct {
    Wallet struct {
        Password string `help:"wallet encryption password" secret:"true"`
    }
}
```

A `secret` field **may not carry a `default` or `releaseDefault`**; `Bind`
panics if it does. A default reaches production, so a placeholder password in
the source tree is the password of every deployment that never overrode it, and
it is in every clone, image and CI log. It is not a weak secret, it is a public
one.

Then call `CheckSecrets` at startup, or the rule only covers half the problem:
without a shipped placeholder *and* without a startup check, removing the
placeholder silently yields an empty key.

For a local convenience value, pair a `devDefault` with an explicitly empty
`releaseDefault`:

```go
Password string `secret:"true" devDefault:"dev-only" releaseDefault:""`
```

## Build stamp and metrics

A plain `go build` already gives you the commit, the build time and whether the
tree was dirty. Mount the debug server and `/version/` works with no wiring.

Two lines get the rest:

```go
monitor.Register(nil)   // process and runtime series, so /metrics is not empty
version.Register(nil)   // the version_info series
```

Only the semantic version needs a Makefile flag, because `go build` does not
read your git tag:

```makefile
VERSION_PKG := gitlab.internal/tuan.quang.tran/aioz-common/version
LDFLAGS := -X $(VERSION_PKG).buildVersion=$(shell git describe --tags --abbrev=0) \
           -X $(VERSION_PKG).channel=release
```

`--abbrev=0` matters: bare `git describe` yields `v2.4.1-3-gabc1234`, which
semver reads as a prerelease *of* v2.4.1, so a build three commits past the tag
sorts below it. `-X` also only patches a plain `string` variable - aimed at a
struct field it names a symbol that does not exist and the linker silently
drops it.

`channel` selects which config defaults apply (`devDefault` vs
`releaseDefault`). It is declared rather than derived, because it is a choice
about how the binary should behave. `Info.Release` is the opposite: it is
derived from evidence, so a build from a dirty tree reports `release: false`
however it was labelled.

## Choosing a credential

This is the decision people get wrong most often, so it gets a table.

| You need | Use | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A session, CSRF token, invite, password reset | [`secret.NewToken`](../secret/README.md) | Opaque, hashed at rest, revoked with a `DELETE` |
| An API key a machine presents | `secret.NewKey` | Public id for O(1) lookup, secret half hashed, checksum for offline rejection |
| MFA recovery codes | `secret.NewCodes` | Crockford base32, folds what a person mistypes |
| A token a verifier checks **without reaching your database** | [`jwt`](../jwt/README.md) | Self-describing, signed |
| A database key or a correlation id | [`uuid`](../uuid/README.md) | Sortable, not a credential |
| A password | bcrypt or argon2id, in your service | Needs a slow, tunable hash; none of the above |

**Default to `secret`, not `jwt`.** A JWT cannot be revoked before it expires,
which is the price of the verifier not needing a lookup. If both ends already
talk to the same coordinator on every request, you are paying that price for
nothing. Reach for `jwt` when the verifier is a third party, an edge worker, or
another company's service.

`uuid.New()` is UUIDv7: about 74 random bits behind a 48-bit millisecond
timestamp. It is a database key and never a bearer token.

## Testing against these packages

Three of the packages exist mostly to make tests deterministic, and a service
that ignores them ends up with a slow, flaky suite:

- [`time2`](../time2/README.md) - take a `context.Context` and read the clock
  with `time2.Now(ctx)`. A test then advances a machine instead of sleeping.
  `jwt` does this, which is how its expiry tests run in microseconds.
- [`cycle`](../cycle/README.md) - `TriggerWait()` runs a background chore once,
  synchronously, so a test asserts on the result rather than on a timer.
- [`stats/testcontext`](../stats/README.md) - a context canceled when the test
  ends, with `Go`/`Wait`/`Cleanup` for background goroutines.

```go
ctx, machine := time2.WithNewMachine(context.Background())
machine.BlockThenAdvance(ctx, 1, time.Hour)   // wait for the timer, then jump
```

Use `BlockThenAdvance`, not bare `Advance`: if the code under test has not
created its timer yet, the jump passes it by and the test hangs or passes for
the wrong reason.

## Errors that cross the HTTP boundary

[`apierr`](../apierr/README.md) carries a status, a machine-readable reason
slug and the underlying cause. A service defines its own reasons on top rather
than inventing a parallel error type.

## Migrating from the old packages

| Old import | New import |
| --- | --- |
| `aioz-config` | `aioz-common/config` |
| `aioz-logger` | `aioz-common/logger` |
| `aioz-stats/...` | `aioz-common/stats/...` |
| `aioz-common/stats/version` | `aioz-common/version` |
| `aioz-template/internal/utils/...` | `aioz-common/{apierr,cycle,lifecycle,logging}` |

`stats/version` still works: it is aliases with deprecation notices. Point new
`-ldflags` at the new path, though, because the link-time variables live there.

For a service still on depin's copies of these utilities, the twelve packages
imported from depin kept their original package names, so the change is an
import path rewrite rather than an API rewrite:

```
aioz-depin/internal/memory   ->  aioz-common/memory
aioz-depin/pkg/common/time2  ->  aioz-common/time2
aioz-depin/pkg/readcloser    ->  aioz-common/readcloser
```

The exceptions are the packages that already existed here under a different
API - `lifecycle`, `debug`, `version`, `testcontext`, `cfgstruct` and
`grpcerr` - which need a real reconciliation rather than a rewrite.
